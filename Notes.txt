OVM Overflow mode. OVM determines what is loaded into the destination accumulator
when an overflow occurs:

	OVM = 0 An overflowed result from either the ALU or the multiplier?s adder
			overflows normally in the destination accumulator.
	OVM = 1 The destination accumulator is set to either the most positive value
			(00 7FFF FFFFh) or the most negative value (FF 8000 0000h) upon
			encountering an overflow.

The SSBX and RSBX instructions set and reset OVM, respectively.

FRCT	Fractional mode. When FRCT is 1, the multiplier output is left-shifted by one bit to
		compensate for an extra sign bit.

ASM  

Accumulator shift mode. The 5-bit ASM field specifies a shift value within a ?16
through 15 range and is coded as a 2s-complement value. Instructions with a
parallel store, as well as STH, STL, ADD, SUB, and LD, use this shift capability. ASM
can be loaded from data memory or by the LD instruction using a short-immediate
operand.
