Gate 0 Entry (Interface Gate)

0x0000	(id)
0x0021	(flags) (active, look for signal crossing)
0x0000	(start MSB)
0x0003	(start LSB)
0x0000	(adjusted start)
0x0006	(width)
0x0005	(height)

Gate 1 Entry (set up as Wall gate 1)

0x0001	(id)
0x0069	(flags)(active, wall 1, signal crossing, uses tracking)
0x0000	(start MSB)
0x0004	(start LSB)
0x0000	(adjusted start)
0x0009	(width)
0x0003	(height)

Gate 2 Entry (set up as Wall gate 2)

0x0002	(id)
0x00f1	(flags)(active, wall 2, signal crossing, uses tracking, find peak)
0xffff	(start MSB)
0xfffe	(start LSB)
0x0000	(adjusted start)
0x0007	(width)
0x0006	(height)


	; Bit assignments for the Gate Function flags:
	;
	; bit 0 :	0 = gate is inactive
	; 			1 = gate is active
	; bit 1 :	0 = flag if signal greater than gate (max gate)
	; 			1 = flag if signal less than gate (min gate)
	; bit 2 :	0 = no secondary flag
	;			1 = secondary flag if signal does NOT exceed gate
	;				(useful for loss of interface or backwall detection)
	; bit 3:	0 = not used for wall measurement
	;			1 = used as first gate for wall measurement
	; bit 4:	0 = not used for wall measurement
	;			1 = used as second gate for wall measurement
	; bit 5:	0 = do not search for signal crossing
	;			1 = search for signal crossing
	;				(must be set if gate is interface or bits 3 or 4 set)
	; bit 6:	0 = gate does not use interface tracking
	;			1 = gate uses interface tracking
	;				(interface gate itself must NOT use tracking)
	; bit 7:	0 = do not search for a peak
	;			1 = search for a peak
	;


	; word 0: first gate ID number (first gate is always interface gate)
	; word 1: gate function flags (see below)
	; word 2: gate start location MSB
	; word 3: gate start location LSB
	; word 4: gate adjusted start location
	; word 5: gate width
	; word 6: gate height
